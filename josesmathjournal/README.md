# Advanced Mathematics Course Website

This project is an educational platform similar to Khan Academy but focuses on advanced mathematics topics. The website features courses on Functional Analysis, Differential Geometry and Linear Algebra. 

## Motivation
This is my second project as part of the Software Engineering program for PerScholas. Moreover though, this is something that I have been wanting to create for years but have never had the know how. It has been a fantastic learning experience and a joy to be able to bring the skeleton of this website to life. I will continue to work on this project likely, for the rest of my life as I continue to fill it with more mathematics to help increase access to math and as a way for me to learn more math and to learn it better.

## Features

- Interactive chapters with video content pulled from YouTube using YouTube API V3.
- A Pomodoro clock feature to help learners manage their study time.
- Each course has a dedicated page with chapters and sub-chapters for structured learning.

## Usage
Navigate to the desired course from the homepage via the navigation bar and select a chapter to view the videos and watch the content.

Use the Pomodoro clock in the navbar to time your study sessions. It is best to take a 5 minute break after 25 minutes for 4 sessions and then take an hour break.
